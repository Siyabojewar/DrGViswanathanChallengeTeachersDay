Q)A. Panoramix's Prediction
A prime number is a number which has exactly two distinct divisors: one and itself. For example, numbers 2, 7, 3 are prime, and 1, 6, 4 are not.
The next prime number after x is the smallest prime number greater than x. For example, the next prime number after 2 is 3, and the next prime number after 3 is 5. Note that there is exactly one next prime number after each number. So 5 is not the next prime number for 2.
One cold April morning Panoramix predicted that soon Kakofonix will break free from his straitjacket, and this will be a black day for the residents of the Gallic countryside.
Panoramix's prophecy tells that if some day Asterix and Obelix beat exactly x Roman soldiers, where x is a prime number, and next day they beat exactly y Roman soldiers, where y is the next prime number after x, then it's time to wait for Armageddon, for nothing can shut Kakofonix up while he sings his infernal song.
Yesterday the Gauls beat n Roman soldiers and it turned out that the number n was prime! Today their victims were a troop of m Romans (m > n). Determine whether the Gauls should wait for the black day after today's victory of Asterix and Obelix?
Input
The first and only input line contains two positive integers — n and m (2 ≤ n < m ≤ 50). It is guaranteed that n is prime.
Pretests contain all the cases with restrictions 2 ≤ n < m ≤ 4.
Output
Print YES, if m is the next prime number after n, or NO otherwise.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

bool isPrime(int x) {
    if (x < 2) return false;
    for (int d = 2; d * d <= x; ++d) {
        if (x % d == 0) return false;
    }
    return true;
}

int main() {
    int n, m;
    if (!(cin >> n >> m)) return 0;

    int next = -1;
    for (int i = n + 1; i <= 100; ++i) {
        if (isPrime(i)) { next = i; break; }
    }

    cout << (m == next ? "YES" : "NO");
    return 0;
}
