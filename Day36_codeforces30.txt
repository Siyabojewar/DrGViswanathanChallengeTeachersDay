Q)A. Lucky Division
Petya loves lucky numbers. Everybody knows that lucky numbers are positive integers whose decimal representation contains only the lucky digits 4 and 7. For example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not.
Petya calls a number almost lucky if it could be evenly divided by some lucky number. Help him find out if the given number n is almost lucky.
Input
The single line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number that needs to be checked.
Output
In the only line print "YES" (without the quotes), if number n is almost lucky. Otherwise, print "NO" (without the quotes).

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    long long n;
    if (!(cin >> n)) return 0;

    vector<int> luckies;
    for (int i = 1; i <= 1000; ++i) {
        int x = i;
        bool ok = true;
        while (x > 0) {
            int d = x % 10;
            if (d != 4 && d != 7) { ok = false; break; }
            x /= 10;
        }
        if (ok) luckies.push_back(i);
    }

    for (int L : luckies) {
        if (L > 0 && n % L == 0) {
            cout << "YES";
            return 0;
        }
    }
    cout << "NO";
    return 0;
}
